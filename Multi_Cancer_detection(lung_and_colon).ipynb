        "The basic idea is that a Global Average Pooling is too simplistic since some of the regions are more relevant than others. So we build an attention mechanism to turn pixels in the GAP on an off before the pooling and then rescale (Lambda layer) the results based on the number of pixels. The model could be seen as a sort of 'global weighted average' pooling. There is probably something published about it and it is very similar to the kind of attention models used in NLP. It is largely based on the insight that the winning solution annotated and trained a UNET model to segmenting the hand and transforming it. This seems very tedious if we could just learn attention.\n"
