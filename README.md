# A Multi-cancer Detection for Lung and Colon Cancer Using CNN, RNN and Transfer Learning

'''Lung and colon malignancies are among the most
prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide, these cancers account
for over 25% of global cancer-related deaths, where early
detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. However,
current AI-based multi-cancer detection systems face several lim-
itations: (1) poor generalization across different tissue types, (2)
inadequate modeling of spatial relationships in histopathological
patterns, and (3) limited interpretability, which hinders clinical
adoption. In this study, we evaluate four state-of-the-art deep
learning models for multi-cancer classification: two CNN-based
transfer learning models (ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B0) and two
recurrent models (LSTM and BiLSTM). These models achieved
impressive classification accuracies of 98.03%, 99.85%, 63.51%,
and 94.89%, respectively. Experiments were conducted on the
LC25000 dataset, from which 2,676 histopathological image
samples with expert annotations were used. This work contributes
two main advancements: (1) quantitative evidence of CNN-
RNN synergy in histopathology analysis, and (2) establishing
benchmark performance on a mid-scale dataset for multi-cancer
classification.'''
